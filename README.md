From simulating physics problems to engineering software solutions, I thrive on pushing the boundaries of computation. My background in Computational Physics fueled my transition to software engineering, where I now focus on leveraging scientific computing, Big Data, and ML/AI to drive breakthroughs in research and bring science fiction concepts to life. 

I'm proficient in languages like Python, Java, and JavaScript, and am constantly seeking innovative ways to apply my knowledge to solve complex problems and create novel algorithms. 

I'm not just learning the future; I'm building it.
